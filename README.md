### Introduction 
This is the code for the laboratory exercise about neural networks and multi-layer perceptrons. After executing `startup.m`, the code should be able to be execute from this current folder.

## Project structure
The code has been divided in different folders:

    .
    ├── datasets                       % Directory containing the provided datset
    ├── preprocessing                  % Small piece of code for testing preprocessing
    ├── results                        % Results from the experiments
    └── src
        ├── classifiers                 % Base structure for the MLP
        └── experiments                 % All the experiment files


## Experiments

All the experiment files output their corresponding results in a .csv file; these files are named as reports of that particular file. The history result files contain the in MATLAB'a command window.
